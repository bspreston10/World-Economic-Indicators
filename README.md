# Business Objective
The objective of this analysis is to assess the patterns of global economic development from 1960 to 2018. The analysis aims to identify how key metrics such as GDP, population growth, life expectancy, electric power consumption, and Human Development Index (HDI) evolve over time by region. This data-driven insight can inform policymakers, international development agencies, and global corporations on regional economic performance and guide strategic investments, especially in regions projected to have the greatest growth.

# Key Insights
1. Economic Expansion vs Population Growth: There is exponential GDP growth across most regions, while population growth follows a more linear trend. The rapid increase in GDP of East Asia & Pacific from the 1980s onwards, driven largely by China, highlights the region's rise as a global economic power.

3. Life Expectancy & GDP: Regions with higher GDP per capita generally show higher life expectancy. Developed nations (represented by larger, high GDP bubbles) exhibit better health outcomes but consist of a smaller proportion of the global population.

4. HDI by Region: North America and Europe have the highest HDI scores, indicating high levels of human development, including life expectancy, education, and standards of living. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia lag behind, highlighting the need for targeted development in these regions.

5. Electric Power Consumption & Economic Growth: A strong correlation exists between electric power consumption and GDP per capita, suggesting that energy infrastructure development is critical for continued economic growth.

# Recommendations
1. Target Investment in Energy Infrastructure: Developing regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia show potential for economic growth but need significant investments in power infrastructure to support GDP expansion. Governments and international investors should focus on increasing energy access to foster industrial growth and improve living conditions.

2. Focus on Healthcare and Education: Although GDP is growing, many regions still exhibit lower life expectancy and HDI scores. To maximize the benefit of economic growth, policymakers in developing regions should invest in improving healthcare and education systems, as these are critical drivers of long-term human development.

3. Sustainable Growth Strategies for Asia and Africa: As East Asia and South Asia continue their rapid growth, policies should focus on sustainable development to prevent economic disparities and ensure that all population segments benefit from the expansion.

4. Explore Technological Innovation in High-Energy-Consumption Regions: High-GDP regions such as North America and Europe consume significant amounts of energy. Encouraging technological advancements in renewable energy and efficient consumption could maintain growth while minimizing environmental impacts.
